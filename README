ADMIXTOOLS version 7.0  6/24/20 (for Linux and Mac)

See README.INSTALL for installation info. 

The ADMIXTOOLS package implements 5 methods described in 
Patterson et al. (2012) Ancient Admixture in Human History. Details of the methods and algorithm can be found in this paper.

The package contains 6 programs: 
convertf: See README.CONVERTF for documentation of programs for converting file formats.
qp3Pop: See README.3PopTest for details of running f_3 test. This test can be used as a format test of admixture with 3 populations.
qpBound: See README.3PopTest for details of running qpBound. This test can be used for estimating bounds on the admixture proportions, given 3 populations (2 reference and one target).
qpDstat: See README.Dstatistics for details of running D-statistics. This is a formal test of admixture with 4 populations.
qpF4Ratio: See README.F4RatioTest for details of running F4 ratio estimation. This program computes the admixture proportion by taking the ratio of two f4 tests.
rolloff:  See README.ROLLOFF/ README.ROLLOFF_OUTPUT for details for running rolloff. This program can be used for dating admixture events.
 
Executables and source code:
----------------------------
All C executables are in the bin/ directory.

We have placed source code for all C executables in the src/ directory, 
for users who wish to modify and recompile our programs.  For example, to
recompile the programs, type
"cd src"
"make clobber"
"make install"      

If you are building on a Mac, you will need gsl and openblas installed. 
"brew install gsl"
"brew install homebrew/science/openblas"
Uncomment the lines in src/Makefile that modify the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS. 

If you have trouble compiling and running our code, try compiling and
running the examples in the examples/ directory. Download the example
datasets from https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/sites/reich.hms.harvard.edu/files/inline-files/AdmixTools_Example_Data.tar_.gz
and untar in the root AdmixTools directory, creating a subdirectory called ./data. 

"cd examples"
"./mklog"

If you are unable to run the examples successfully, please contact
your system administrator for help, as this is probably systems issue which is
beyond our scope.

*** NEW *** 
1) 
Users of ADMIXTOOLS should know that an alternate version in R (native mode -- reimplementation) 
written by Robert Maier is also available on Github.  
See <https://github.com/uqrmaie1/admixtools> 
Executables run fast, and it has features not available in this C version, such as interactive 
 exploration of graph phylogenies.

2) 
version 7.0 has numerous upgrades. 
a) Two new executables --qpfstats qpfmv allow precomputation of f-statistic basis.  
This can greatly reduce computation costs.  
b) qpAdm, qpWave, qpGraph support qpfstats output as input.  
*** This is a much improved way of running with allsnps: YES.    *** 
c)  A new experimental feature of qpGraph (halfscore: YES) allows 
 comparison of 2 phylogenies + a (weak) goodness of fit score.  Be careful 
 if running with a large nnumber of populations and consider reducing block size say 
 blgsize: .005 


*** Fairly NEW *** 
Lightweight onlline documentation added, thanks to Eric Deveaud                             
<executable>  or <executable> -h  to get brief documentation or

*** Fairly NEW ***  
Alter number of chromosomes:   
numchrom:  <zzz>
zzz should be the autosome number (default 22 -- the number for humans) 

Custom block numbers (for jackknife) 
blockname:  <bbb> 
bbb should contain a list of snps 1 / line followed by a block number (integer) 
block number should be at least 1.  -1 -> snp ignored.  If this option is used 
snps not in list will be ignored.
