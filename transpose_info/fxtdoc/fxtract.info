### 
A wrapper for Matt Mah's fast extract scripts.  
fxtract does a very simple job -- extract samples from a 
TGENO dataset to make a new TGENO dataset with fewer samples


If you run fxtract then ~np29/o2bin should be in your path.

This exact parfile ws above will also work for convertf 
*** new convertf feature *** 
--- instem and outstem -- stem for .ind .snp .geno files 
fxtract is a bare bones script -- a driver for Matt Mah's fast extract on tgeno files 

If you want fancy features of convertf or to make plink files first run fxtract and 
then convertf on the output.  

tempdir: usage is a little complicated but intended to be flexible and convenient
If you do nothing, then w scratch working directory is used in /tmp 
This is not ideal as on O2 /tmp is sometimes full.  
If you set an environment variable $STMP then a scratch directory 
is used under that (and then deleted) 
I have STMP=/n/scratch/users/n/np29 
Alternatively a working directory can be specified explicitly by tempdir:
