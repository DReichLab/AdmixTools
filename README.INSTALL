ADMIXTOOLS version 5.0  6/28/18 (for Linux and Mac)

Best is to recompile on your system. 

You will need to be able to link GNU Scientific library(gsl) , BLAS, gfortran, and prpbably lapack.  
This Makefile expects opeenblas but other versions of BLAS should be OK.  Edit the Makefile 
appropriately.

cd src;  make clobber; make all; make install.  Eexcutables will be in ../bin

A Makefile that worked for a Mac (El Capitan) is in src/Makefile.mac
